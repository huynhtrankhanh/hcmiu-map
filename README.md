# hcmiu-map
project for data structures and algorithms course. interactive map of HCMIU, pathfinding, time estimation

- **map:** view what HCMIU has to offer. labs, cafeterias, classrooms, gates, parking lots
- **path finding:** find shortest path from one point to another
- **traveling salesman:** find shortest path to visit all places you specify

**disclaimer:**
- this is just a proof of concept of what is possible. the project won't be updated to reflect changes that might occur after the course is over
- there won't be any GPS. we are just normal civilians, having no access to ultra precise GPS hardware
